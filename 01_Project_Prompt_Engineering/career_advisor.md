# AI Career Advisor (Prompt Engineering)

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a simple LLM-based chatbot that provides basic career guidance for students using prompt engineering only.

Prompt design:
- Role-based prompt (system): defines the model's role as a career advisor.
- Instruction prompt: instructs the model to reply simply and concisely.
- Few-shot examples: provide sample user-assistant pairs to set response style.

Test queries and expected outputs are included in the notebook.

Conclusion:
Prompt engineering can significantly improve the quality and consistency of LLM outputs without using external data.
